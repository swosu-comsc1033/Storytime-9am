Once upon a time, in a dark and creepy forest. . .
There was a shiny orb that descended from above the trees and landed in front of me.
Then I thought, should I retrieve it or run for my life.
So I decided to run for my life 
Until a dragon came out of nowhere and started to blow its fiery hell upon me.
Scared poopless I ran the other way finding out that the orb gives me unlimited strength.
