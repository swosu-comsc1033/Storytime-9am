As I awoke, I didn't realize this would be the day that would change the course of my life forever.
It started the same as any other day with me running late and grabing my coffee as I run out the door.
But as I reached for my coffee, this became more than just a normal day. In the coffee was a FLargleschnarf.
Which was strange since I didn't ask the barista for FLargleshnarf.
I contemplated complaining until said barista was fired, but decided to continue on with my day since I was running late.
FLargleshnarfs, what strange creatures they are; essentially they are just little balls of fluff.
This little ball of fluff, little did I know, was about to Ace my test for me.
