Once upon a time in a computer science class not so far away there were four eager students given an assignment to help them learn Git.
The four students were unaware of a dark eclipsing presence hovering over them in the computer lab.
Suddenly, a portal appeared above the four students, dragging them into a different dimension.
Although so scared of getting started with GIT because of the dark screen command prompt, the team coorperation and encouragement led us through to working hard with GIT to achieve our goal.
